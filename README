This is a very simple system to record builds done on remote machines.
It is part of a low-budget nightly-build system we've used since 2005.
One CGI is used to access the results of a 'build db' (a text file)
with one record (line) for each build. The 'reader' CGI returns an
HTML table where summary information about a component is shown and a
link to a verbose log is provided. Two CGIs are used to upload
information about a build. One of the CGIs uploads a log for the
build, whcih can be very verbose, and a second uploads summary stats
about a particular component, if it built, passed tests, built RPMs,
etc.
